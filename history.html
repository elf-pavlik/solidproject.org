          <h2>Research at MIT et al.</h2>
          <p>The Solid project came out of research at MIT into a
          powerful web of data</p>
          <p>In 2000, MIT <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/">CSAIL</a>
          Decentralised Infomation Group (<a href=
          "https://groups.csail.mit.edu/dig/">DIG</a>) got funding from
          DARPA to work on Semantic Web, which produced RDF-based
          systems, and N3 rules. The python codebase for that work is now
          at <a class="c8" href=
          "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/linkeddata/swap&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1707316247988683&amp;usg=AOvVaw1hTtIuun8mL1M0-PBpvrCk">
          https://github.com/linkeddata/swap</a></p>
          <p>From 1999 when the browsers developed the ability to do
          “<a class="c8" href=
          "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1707316247989069&amp;usg=AOvVaw21nBbfS-yxsCAhd2JARxP5">AJAX</a>”,
           to call back from the web page client to the server using
          what was XMLRPCRequest and became fetch(), then it was possible
          to build systems with the App in the client, with calls back to
          the server for data storage.</p>
          <p>The project in the lab responded to that possibility with
          the “Tabulator” - a JS client which would allow the user to
          explore linked data on the web.</p>

          <p>2009: Tim BL gave a TED Talk about the importance of the
          web of data, not just documents, open data on the web. He also
          talks about the web and Linked Data at the Web Summit that
          year.</p>
          <p>2009: An important aspect of the project was that it attempts to
          make a class="c11"&gt;read-write web of data.  
          Anything the user could read and had permission to write could
          also be written. The “Read-Write Web” was a mantra. The August
          2009 Design Issues notes ”<a class="c8" href=
          "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/ReadWriteLinkedData.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1707316247989663&amp;usg=AOvVaw1-YMRFj9lrr2n12weBEuVw">Read-Write

          Aware Cloud Storage”</a> emphasized the need for a
          read-write web of linked data as a response to the data silos
          of current social network sites.</p>
      
          <p>2009? an ISWC paper, Hollenbahch, J, et al, MIT, “<a class="c8" href=

            rdf metadata to enable access control on the social semantic
            web</a>”</p>
        
          <p>2011: There was a <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/community/rww/">Read-Write Web Cmmunity
          Group</a>, started in 2011, most of its activity in 2012, which
          discussed the RWW up till around 2017</p>
          <p>in 2012, at ISWC, for example, Tim gave a <a href=
          "https://videolectures.net/iswc2012_berners_lee_semantic_web/?t=70">
          talk</a> about the worlkd od RWLD and the need for
          standardising the protocol</p>
          <p>But once users could write as well as read, access control
          was important.  The W3C’s own site had per-item RDF-based
          access control with a UI. The tabulator project more or less
          copied that system, but this time storing access control
          information in RDF files rather than an access database.</p>
      
          <h2>The name Solid</h2>
      
          <p>Later work on the Read-writeLinked Data theme was in
          collaboration between MIT and QCRI, with funding from QCRI.
           That is when Sandro Hawke thought of the name “Solid” for
          “Social Linked Data” as a name for the platform - the interface
          spec between client and server - the protocol.</p>
      
          <p>2016: Mansour, E., Sambra, A.V., Hawke, S., Zereba, M., Capadisli,
          S., Ghanem, A., Aboulnaga, A. and Berners-Lee, T., 2016, April.
          A demonstration of the solid platform for social web
          applications. In Proceedings of the 25th international
          conference companion on world wide web (pp. 223-226) (<a class=

          <p>2015: As the platform was becoming something which it would be
          important to standardize and spread, and as for such a broad
          platform, some customers would need to be able to call on
          commercial products and services, there was thought of making a
          company – a bit as Netscape had for the early Web - provide
          commercial solutions.</p>
          <p>In 2015, The team approached Mastercard Labs to see whether
          they would consider funding such a company. After much
          technical due diligence, the MC Labs team felt that the
          platform itself needed more work in the lab.  The specs
          and the open source code needed to be more elaborate.
           They did then fund the next two years of work in the
          lab.</p>
          <h2>Forming Inrupt.com</h2>
          <p>In 2017, we looked again at forming a company.  Now the
          time was ripe, with support from local VC Glasswing, and
          others. The company was Inrupt.</p>
          <p>Inrupt created its own enterprise grade Solid Protocol
          compatible products,  and also funded work at IMEC at
          Ghent University on open source code.</p>
          <p>The Solid organization holding the specs was a Github
          organization, and so much of the interaction used github
          processes and also Gitter chat.  Gitter chat existed
          around any github org or repo. (Gitter chat later moved to Matrix protcol, now
          in use in 2023).  The Solid community had also a 
          <a href="https://solidproject.org/">web site</a>
          and a  <a href="https://forum.solidproject.org/">forum</a>,
           and series of meetups “Solid World” which went
          online with Covid.</p>
      
          <p>2018: In October  2018,  Melvin Carvalho proposed the
          W3C Solid Community group.  Code contributors were asked
          to join the CG for the limited IP commitment it would give.
            A future possible W3C Working group would give much
          better Royalty Free guarantees, than the CG.</p>
